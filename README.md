# Probabilistic-Counting
Some Algoithms to Count Unique Elements.

- The project is assignment for master course Advances in Data Mining and it is based on probabilistic methods of counting distinct elements from different hash. 

- Data was generated randomly simulating the result of a hash function, so they are binary bitstreams uniform distributed.

- Read ||"advances-data-mining.pdf"|| for further information.
